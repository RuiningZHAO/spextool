---Xvspec----

Xvspec is a resizable widget that displays spectra extracted using Spextool. 

The widget can be started from the command line as:

   IDL> xvspec,POSITION=position,FWHM=fwhm,VMODE=vmode,PLOTLINMAX=plotlinmax,$
               PLOTREPLACE=plotreplace,PLOTFIX=plotfix,CANCEL=cancel

   IDL> xvspec,afile,POSITION=position,VMODE=vmode,FWHM=fwhm,$
               PLOTLINMAX=plotlinmax,PLOTREPLACE=plotreplace,PLOTFIX=plotfix,$
	       CANCEL=cancel

   IDL> xvspec,afile,bfile,POSITION=position,VMODE=vmode,FWHM=fwhm,$
               PLOTLINMAX=plotlinmax,PLOTREPLACE=plotreplace,PLOTFIX=plotfix,$
	       CANCEL=cancel

where,

   afile - A string giving the filename of a SpeX spectral FITS image.
   bfile - A string giving the filename of a SpeX spectral FITS image.
           However, the bfile must be nearly identical to the afile.  That
	   is, it must effectively be the "B Beam" extraction of a pair
	   subtracted extraction. 

Buttons:

   File:

     Load FITS                : Loads a Spextool FITS image
                                (keyboard command 'l')
     View Header              : To view the FITS header
     Write Spextool FITS File : To write a spextool FITS file to disk.
     Write ASCII File         : To write an ASCII file to disk.

   Mode:

     Ladder     : To plot orders one on top of another.
     Continuous : To plot the orders continuously on a single plot.

   Buffer:

     A Buffer :  Plot the A buffer spectrum.
     B Buffer :  Plot the B buffer spectrum.	

   Spectrum:    

     Flux           : View the flux spectrum (keyboard command 'f')
     Error          :  View the error spectrum (keyboard command 'e')
     S/N            : View the S/N spectum (keyboard command 's')

   Order:  

     Used to select which order to center the view on.

   Aperture:  

     Used to select which aperture to view.

   Units:

     Wavelength     : Choose from various wavelength units.
     Flux Density   : Choose from various flux (density) units.

   Flags:

     Lincor Max Pixel :  Set to plot pixels over the linearity
                         correction maxmimum value.
     Replace Pixel    :  Set to plot pixels that were replaced by xspextool.
     Fixed Pixel      :  Set to plot pixels that were fixed by xcleanspec.

   Plot: 

     X log             :  Set for a logarithmic X axis.
     Y log             :  Set for a logarithmic Y axis.
     Fix Y Range       :  Set to fix the Y range.  This can be useful when 
                          switching between aperture.
     Normalize Spectra :  To normalized the spectra by the median value.
		       

   Tools:  

     Smooth         :  Set to a value in order to boxcar smooth the data.
                       Set to zero to return to the default value.
