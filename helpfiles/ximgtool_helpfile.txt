---Ximgtool----

Ximgtool is resizable widget that can be used to view FITS images.  It
can also be used to view any two-dimensional array.  Please see the
program header to learn how to call ximgtool from the command line.
Each menu along the top of the widget is described below and a summary
of the cursor commands is given at the end.

                    The user can draw a box by left-clicking, holding,
                    and moving the cursor.  When the button is released,
                    the range of the image is determined using only the
                    pixels in the box.  The actual min and max values
                    are determined using the method selected under the
                    Range Menu Bar (MinMax, 99.5%, 99%, 98%, 95%).  Note
                    that if 'User' is selected under the Range Menu Bar
                    nothing will occur.

                    The user can move the box by left-clicking INSIDE
                    THE BOX, holding, and moving the cursor and can
                    resize the box by clicking on the lower right hand
                    corner of the box.  The image range will then be
                    updated.  To compute the range using the entire
                    image, type 'c'.


      Image Exam -  Select to enter the Image Exam mode.  Must use 
                    'd', 'l', 'm' to select which mode is actully used.

                    'd' - The Distance Mode.

                          The user can click, hold, and move and the
                          distance between the starting position and
                          current position are given.  Use the left
                          mouse button to compute a distance along a
                          diagonal, the middle mouse button to compute a
                          distance along a column, and the right mouse
                          button along a row.  Type 'c' to clear the
                          display.

                    'l' - The Line Cut Mode.

                          The user can click, hold, and move to see a
                          line cut (the data will be shown in xzoomplot,
                          type ? to see the manual page.)  Use the left
                          mouse button to compute a distance along a
                          diagonal, the middle mouse button to compute a
                          distance along a column, and the right mouse
                          button along a row.  Type 'c' to clear the
                          display.

                    'm' - The Moments mode.

                          The user can draw a box by left-clicking,
                          holding, and moving the cursor.  When the
                          button is released, the moments (e.g., mean,
                          stddev, etc.)  of the pixels in the box are
                          shown.

                          The user can move the box by left-clicking
                          INSIDE THE BOX, holding, and moving the cursor
                          and can resize the box by clicking on the
                          lower right hand corner of the box.  The image
                          range will then be updated.  To compute the
                          range using the entire image, type 'c'.

                             Cursor Commands
============================================================================


up arrow    - Moves the cursor up 1 pixel


down arrow  - Moves the cursor down 1 pixel


left arrow  - Moves the cursor left 1 pixel


right arrow - Moves the cursor right 1 pixel

(Note that these commands do not always work when the image is zoomed out).

-           - To set the minimum value of the image range with the current 
              pixel.  Must be in the Range cursor mode.


= or +      - To set the maximum value of the image range with the current 
              pixel.  Must be in the Range cursor mode.


b           - To change to the previous buffer (back) selected in the 
              Blink Menu.


f           - To change to the next buffer (forward) selected in the Blink Menu.


c           - To clear any current box or line.  The cursor mode remains 
              in the current mode.


l           - Type to perform a 'l'ine cut under the Image Exam Mode.
              To perform a line cut in any direction, use the left-most
              mouse button.  To perform a line cut along a column, use
              the middle mouse button and to perform a line cut along a
              row, use the right-most mouse button.  When the button is
              released, aa plot window will appear with the line cut.
              Please type 'h' in the plot window for the xzoomplot help
              window.  The line can be move by selecting the end of the
              line.


m           - Type to compute the 'm'oments of a subset of pixels in the
              Image Exam mode.  The user can draw a box by
              left-clicking, holding, and moving the cursor.  When the
              button is released, a window will appear with the moments
              of the pixel values contained in the box.  The user can
              move the box by left-clicking INSIDE THE BOX, holding, and
              moving the cursor and can resize the box by clicking on
              the lower right hand corner of the box.  When the user
              releases the button, a *NEW* window will appear with the
              moments of the pixels in the new box.  If the previous
              moments window was not moved, the second window will
              appear OVER the first.  To exit out of this mode, type
              'c'.


r           - Type to enter the 'r'ange mode.  The user can draw a box
              by left-clicking, holding, and moving the cursor.  When
              the button is released, the range of the image is
              determined using only the pixels in the box.  The actual
              min and max values are determined using the method
              selected under the Range Menu Bar (MinMax, 99.5%, 99%,
              98%, 95%).  Note that if 'User' is selected under the
              Range Menu Bar nothing will occur.  

              The user can move the box by left-clicking INSIDE THE BOX,
              holding, and moving the cursor and can resize the box by
              clicking on the lower right hand corner of the box.  The
              image range will then be updated.  To compute the range
              using the entire image, type 'c'.

t           - To zoom in/out so that the entire image fits in the display area

z           - Type to enter the 'z'oom mode, the default mode.  A single
              click with the left mouse button will center the image at
              the current position and zoom in by a factor of 2.  A
              click on the center mouse button will center the image at
              the current position and a single click with the
              right-most mouse button with center the image at the
              current position and zoom out by a factor of 2.
